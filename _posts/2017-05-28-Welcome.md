title: Welcome to Statistical Conditioning!
---

Welcome! The purpose of this site it to serve as a repository for exercises useful  for mastering the basics of common statistical methods. 
Learning statistics is a lot like getting into shape. 
You wouldn't expect to go to the gym and listen to your personal trainer talk about the types of exercises you can do to become fit; you have to use that knowledge, which means you have to exercise your muscles. 
Learning statistics through lecture is very similar to listening you your personal trainer talk about fitness: it can be helpful, but it is just the beginning. 
You have to apply what you learn to become proficient at using the statistical methods. 

This site is aimed at supplementing and not replacing formal statistical classes. 
Returning to the fitness analogy, you could walk into a gym and use the equipment with no understanding of the correct technique.
At best this could be inefficient; at worst, it could lead to injury.
Likewise, to best use this site you need some formal training in statistics. 
Statistical concepts can be complex an are not always intuitive. 
So, to master the basics of statistics requires active practice using the concepts and procedures often taught in the classroom.
Indeed, one reason for creating this site it to use as a resource supplementing my own teaching.
